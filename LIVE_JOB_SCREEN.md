## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
JSON Files → Backend API → Frontend Components → Live Updates
```

### Real-time Updates
- **Polling**: 3-second intervals for live data
- **WebSocket Support**: Available for more efficient updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when backend unavailable
- **Caching**: Optimized data fetching and caching

### Mock Data Generation
For completed jobs, the system generates realistic mock data to demonstrate:
- Training curves with proper convergence
- Resource utilization patterns
- Timeline progressions
- Performance metrics

### Responsive Design

- **Grid System**: Flexible layout adaptation
- **Touch-friendly**: Mobile interaction support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works across all devices

## Backend Integration

### Python APIs
The backend provides comprehensive job management:

```python
# Enhanced job retrieval with live data
@app.get("/api/jobs/{uid}")
async def get_job_by_uid(uid: str):
    # Searches current and past jobs
    # Enhances running jobs with live metrics
    # Returns comprehensive job data
```

### Data Sources
- **Current Jobs**: `src/data/current-jobs.json`
- **Past Jobs**: `src/data/past-jobs.json`  
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time training monitor API
- **Resource Data**: System monitoring endpoints

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Start the backend APIs
cd python-backend
python main.py  # Port 8000 - Job management
python training_monitor_api.py  # Port 8001 - Live metrics
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev  # Port 3000
```
