## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+ with uv package manager

### Quick Setup

Use the provided colorized Python menu script for easy setup:

```bash
# Windows
menu.bat

# Or run directly with Python
python menu.py

# Options available:
# 1. Install dependencies: Option 1
# 2. Start both frontend and backend: Option 4
```

### Backend Services

Start the enhanced backend services with real-time monitoring:

```bash
# Windows
cd python-backend
start-backend.bat

# Linux/Mac
cd python-backend
chmod +x start-backend.sh
./start-backend.sh
```

This starts:
- **Job Management API** (Port 8000): Job lifecycle management
- **Training Monitor API** (Port 8001): Real-time metrics and monitoring

### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev  # Port 3000
```

### Manual Backend Installation

```bash
# Frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend  
cd python-backend
uv venv
uv run main.py
```
